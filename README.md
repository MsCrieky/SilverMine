- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Validation Results

- W3C Markup Validator:
    - Index.html - No errors or warnings
    - Gallery.html - No errors but a warning: "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed." Here i changed the "section" into a "div" instead and that took away the warning.
    - Contact.html - 4 errors. I had identical "id" in one of the "divs" and "input" which I quickly changed and the result was after that no errors.
